# DjangoXReact

An ecommerce website created with React, Redux, Django & Postgres

## Description

In this repository, we built a completely customized eCommerce / shopping cart application from scratch using Django & React. This project is a collaboration with [@amirhoseinmt](https://www.github.com/amirhoseinmt). We decided it would be fun to put our skills togerther and make a project with a Django backend/API and connect it to a React frontend/design. You can see the website by visiting [Here](https://).
